<H1>EDGE DETECTION USING CANNY ALGORITHM WITH FUZZY C-MEANS THRESHOLDING</H1>
 <h4>ABSTRACT:</h4>
     <p> Edge detection is a fundamental task in image processing that aims to identify boundaries between objects or regions within an image. In this project, we explored the use of thresholding technique - Fuzzy c-means algorithm in combination with the Canny edge detection algorithm to improve the accuracy of edge detection in images. To understand the influence of noise and filter on the performance of modified Canny edge detection algorithm, we utilized addition of Gaussian noise to the original input images at different levels followed by Gaussian filter to eliminate the noise in the image. </p>
      
  <p>The performance of the edge detection algorithms was analyzed under four different conditions: <br><ul><li>(1) with noise and filtering</li><li> (2) without noise and filtering</li><li> (3) with noise but without filtering</li> <li>(4) without noise but with filtering</li> </ul><br>
  
  It is evident from the results that the Fuzzy c-means algorithm shows superior performance at zero noise level than comparing to adaptive thresholding algorithm. When the noise level is increased, the edge detection of bio-medical images is degraded for both the proposed algorithms even for small noise levels (~20%) Overall, our study highlights the importance of choosing appropriate thresholding techniques for different types of images and applications to achieve optimal edge detection results.
